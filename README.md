# Java Guessing Game
This repo contains all the source code for the tutorial for making a simple number guessing game in Java on
my youtube channel called [Theo's Tech Tips](https://youtube.com/theostechtips).
## How to run the game
The game is written in pure java so you should just be able to compile and run without any external libraries or packages.
It was created in [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Just open the project and build and run.
